# Minecraft-server
Didn't make this but heres how to set it up

Go to dashboard.ngrok.com
get your token
make a file called `.env` 
Lay your env out like this:
```
ngrok_token=YOUR_TOKEN
ngrok_region=region(look below for a list a reigons)

us - United States (Ohio)
eu - Europe (Frankfurt)
ap - Asia/Pacific (Singapore)
au - Australia (Sydney)
sa - South America (Sao Paulo)
jp - Japan (Tokyo)
in - India (Mumbai)
```
Now finally just do bash main.sh and your server IP should be stored in ip.txt


# Few things
You need a really good computer to host this; services like repl.it will just make you lag
The ip changes every time you start it
